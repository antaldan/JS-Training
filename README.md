# JS-Training
A series of javascript training examples and exercies

## 1. Objects, prototypes, constructor functions, ES6 classes

In this first lesson we will explore some of the basic concepts of javascript and it's prototype based model.
We will go through:
* Objects - how they are created, differences between creation methods, property descriptors
* Functions as constructors - the usage of `new` operator
* How objects are linked together using prototypes: `[[Prototype]]` (or `__proto__`) vs `prototype` properties
* The `instanceOf` operator
* A deeper dive into ES6 classes
* Q&A
